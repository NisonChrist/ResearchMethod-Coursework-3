        "abstract": "A great deal of geoscience knowledge exists in the form of unstructured text or maps, which are difficult to use by structured models or to process by computers. Thus, it is urgent to transform them to structured knowledge graph (KG). However, the development of geoscience KG (GKG) lags behind the general KG because it involves in the complexity of spatiotemporal relationships and knowledge from multisources. This study constructed a mountain vegetation KG (MVKG) incorporating with vegetation geographical principles, maps, and remote sensing (RS) images with the support of ArcGIS and deep learning method to facilitate the use of vegetation knowledge in various disciplines. The results showed that: 1) for the construction of a GKG, such as the MVKG, it is first necessary to define a strict and compatible ontology to classify and organize all the knowledge in order to facilitate structured representation and storage of them; 2) the MVKG entities were labeled from vegetation maps with the support of ArcGIS, which indicated that the spatiotemporal representation, organization, and analysis techniques of GIS can effectively support the construction of the GKG; 3) the RS image features extracted by the deep learning method were embedded into the properties of the MVKG entities, which will be significant for the MVKG application because RS monitoring is indispensable for the study of vegetation distribution and changes. The MVKG can also enhance the application of vegetation knowledge and information in RS monitoring for vegetation cover and change, mountain ecology, and climate change.",

Knowledge about and around Geographic Information Science and its associated system technologies (GIS) is complex, extensive and emerging rapidly. Taking the challenge, we built a GIS knowledge graph (GIS-KG) by (1) merging existing GIS bodies of knowledge to create a hierarchical ontology and then (2) applying deep-learning methods to map GIS publications to the ontology. We conducted several experiments on information retrieval to evaluate the novelty and effectiveness of the GIS-KG. Results showed the robust support of GIS-KG for knowledge search of existing GIS topics and potential to explore emerging research themes.",

        "abstract": " As an emerging knowledge representation model in the domain of knowledge graphs, geographic knowledge graph can take full advantage of semantic, spatial and temporal information to facilitate answering spatio-temporal questions and completing relations. However, the representation of geographic knowledge graphs still has issues such as the difficulty of unified heterogeneous spatio-temporal data modelling, weak ability to answer spatio-temporal queries for dynamic multiobjective problems, and low efficiency of graph querying. This paper presents a grid-augmented geographic knowledge graph (AugGKG) based on the GeoSOT global subdivision grid model and time slice subgraph architecture. AugGKG discretely normalizes the spatio-temporal data of the graph, which involves five types of nodes and two types of relations. By using the geo-hidden layer of the graph and geocoding algebraic operations, the AugGKG can quickly answer complex multiobjective spatio-temporal queries and complete implicit spatio-temporal relations. Compared with existing geographic knowledge graphs (YAGO, GeoKG and GEKG), the comparative experiments verified the obvious advantages of AugGKG in terms of uniformity of accuracy, completeness, and efficiency. Hence, AugGKG is expected to be regarded as an innovative and robust geographic knowledge graph that can perform fast computation and relation completion for complex spatio-temporal queries in future geospatial question answering applications.",

        "abstract": "Rocks formed during different geologic time record the diverse evolution of the geosphere and biosphere. In the past decades, substantial geoscience data have been made open access, providing invaluable resources for studying the stratigraphy in different regions and at different scales. However, many open datasets have information recorded in natural language with heterogeneous terminologies, short of efficient approaches to analyze them. In this research, we constructed a hybrid Stratigraphic Knowledge Graph (StraKG) to help address this challenge. StraKG has two layers, a simple schema layer and a rich instance layer. For the schemas, we used a short but functional list of classes and relationships, and then incorporated community-recognized terminologies from geological dictionaries. For the instances, we used natural language processing techniques to analyze open text data and obtained massive records, such as rocks and spatial locations. The nodes in the two layers were associated to establish a consistent structure of stratigraphic knowledge. To verify the functionality of StraKG, we applied it to the Baidu encyclopedia, the largest online Chinese encyclopedia. Three experiments were implemented on the topics of stratigraphic correlation, spatial distribution of ophiolite in China, and spatio-temporal distribution of open lithostratigraphic data. The results show that StraKG can provide strong knowledge reference for stratigraphic studies. Used together with data exploration and data mining methods, StraKG illustrates a new approach to analyze the open and big text data in geoscience.",

        "abstract": "Open data initiatives have promoted governmental agencies and scientific organizations to publish data online for reuse. Research of geoscience focuses on processing georeferenced quantitative data (e.g., rock parameters, geochemical tests, geophysical surveys and satellite imagery) for discovering new knowledge. Geological knowledge is the cognitive result of human knowledge of the spatial distribution, evolution and interaction patterns of geological objects or processes. Knowledge graphs (KGs) can formalize unstructured knowledge into structured form and have been used in supporting decision-making recently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that can extract the geological knowledge graph (GKG) from public reports relating to a modelling study. Based on the analysis of basic questions answered by geology, we summarize and abstract geological knowledge elements and then explore a geological knowledge representation model with three levels of ``geological concepts-geological entities-geological relations'' to describe semantic units of geological knowledge and their logic relations. Finally, based on the characteristics of mineral resource reports, the geological knowledge representation model oriented to ``object relationships'' and the hierarchical geological knowledge representation model oriented to ``process relationships'' are proposed with reference to the commonly used geological knowledge graph representation. The research in this paper can provide some implications for the formalization and structured representation of geological knowledge graphs.",

        "abstract": " High-quality Geographic Knowledge Graphs (GeoKGs) are highly anticipated for their potential to provide reliable semantic support in geographical knowledge reasoning, training Geographic Large Language Models (Geo-LLMs), enabling geographical recommendation, and facilitating various geospatial knowledge-driven tasks. However, there is a lack of a standardized quality assessment methodology and clearly defined evaluative indicators in the field of GeoKGs research. This research uses the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to conduct a systematic review of literature and standards in the field of GeoKG in an effort to fill the gap. First, using the lifecycle theory as a guide, we outline and propose five groups including twenty assessment criteria and their accompanying calculation techniques for evaluating GeoKG quality. Then, expanding on this foundation, we present a streamlined evaluation scheme for GeoKGs that relies on just seven key measures, discussing their applicability, utility, and weight scheme in greater detail. After applying the GeoKG quality framework, we stated three key tasks emerge as priorities: the creation of specialized assessment tools, the formation of worldwide standards, and the building of large-scale, high-quality GeoKGs. We believe this thorough and systematic GeoKG quality assessment technique will help construct high-quality GeoKGs and promote GeoKGs as an engine for geo-intelligence applications including Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) systems, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) analyzers, and Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs) models.",

        "abstract": "Geoscience knowledge graph (GKG) can organize various geoscience knowledge into a machine understandable and computable semantic network and is an effective way to organize geoscience knowledge and provide knowledge-related services. As a result, it has gained significant attention and become a frontier in geoscience. Geoscience knowledge is derived from many disciplines and has complex spatiotemporal features and relationships of multiple scales, granularities, and dimensions. Therefore, establishing a GKG representation model conforming to the characteristics of geoscience knowledge is the basis and premise for the construction and application of GKG. However, existing knowledge graph representation models leverage fixed tuples that are limited in fully representing complex spatiotemporal features and relationships. To address this issue, this paper first systematically analyzes the categorization and spatiotemporal features and relationships of geoscience knowledge. On this basis, an adaptive representation model for GKG is proposed by considering the complex spatiotemporal features and relationships. Under the constraint of a unified spatiotemporal ontology, this model adopts different tuples to adaptively represent different types of geoscience knowledge according to their spatiotemporal correlation. This model can efficiently represent geoscience knowledge, thereby avoiding the isolation of the spatiotemporal feature representation and improving the accuracy and efficiency of geoscience knowledge retrieval. It can further enable the alignment, transformation, computation, and reasoning of spatiotemporal information through a spatiotemporal ontology.",

        "abstract": "The geoscience knowledge graph (GeoKG) has gained worldwide attention due to its ability in the formal representation of spatiotemporal features and relationships of geoscience knowledge. Currently, a quantitative review of the state and trends in GeoKG is still scarce. Thus, a bibliometric analysis was performed in this study to fill the gap. Specifically, based on 294 research articles published from 2012 to 2023, we conducted analyses in terms of the (1) trends in publications and citations; (2) identification of the major papers, sources, researchers, institutions, and countries; (3) scientific collaboration analysis; and (4) detection of major research topics and tendencies. The results revealed that the interest in GeoKG research has rapidly increased after 2019 and is continually expanding. China is the most productive country in this field. Co-authorship analysis shows that inter-national and inter-institutional collaboration should be reinforced. Keyword analysis indicated that geoscience knowledge representation, information extraction, GeoKG construction, and GeoKG-based multi-source data integration were current hotspots. In addition, several important but currently neglected issues, such as the integration of Large Language Models, are highlighted. The findings of this review provide a systematic overview of the development of GeoKG and provide a valuable reference for future research.",

        "abstract": "Formalized knowledge representation is the foundation of Big Data computing, mining and visualization. Current knowledge representations regard information as items linked to relevant objects or concepts by tree or graph structures. However, geographic knowledge differs from general knowledge, which is more focused on temporal, spatial, and changing knowledge. Thus, discrete knowledge items are difficult to represent geographic states, evolutions, and mechanisms, e.g., the processes of a storm \u201c{9:30-60 mm-precipitation}-{12:00-80 mm-precipitation}-\u2026\u201d. The underlying problem is the constructors of the logic foundation (ALC description language) of current geographic knowledge representations, which cannot provide these descriptions. To address this issue, this study designed a formalized geographic knowledge representation called GeoKG and supplemented the constructors of the ALC description language. Then, an evolution case of administrative divisions of Nanjing was represented with the GeoKG. In order to evaluate the capabilities of our formalized model, two knowledge graphs were constructed by using the GeoKG and the YAGO by using the administrative division case. Then, a set of geographic questions were defined and translated into queries. The query results have shown that GeoKG results are more accurate and complete than the YAGO\u2019s with the enhancing state information. Additionally, the user evaluation verified these improvements, which indicates it is a promising powerful model for geographic knowledge representation.",
